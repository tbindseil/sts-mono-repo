Description: sts db utils
        
        this module houses shared code used to connect to the database
        
        
        first time stuff:
        pip install wheel
        pip install twine
        
        use python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel to make new version
        then remove old whl and tar files
        then use ```python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*``` to reupload
        
        then, in the project the library is to be used in, do
        pip uninstall <name>
        pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple <name>
        to get the latest
        
        once the dependency is solidified, you don't have to use test.pypi, so instead, the above becomes:
        
        use python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel to make new version
        then remove old whl and tar files
        then use ```python3 -m twine upload dist/*``` to reupload
        
        then, in the project the library is to be used in, do
        pip uninstall <name>
        pip install <name>
        to get the latest
        
        Don't forget to save the dependency snapshot in this and the other package!
