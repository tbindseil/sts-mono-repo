lambda that houses debug level, then don't have to redeploy everytime I want to add debug

./run_tests at resources level in dir tree, it kicks off all ./run_tests in the resources themselves

can i do a pip install -U * and update everything? can i do that at the resource level?

    # ultimately, I'll need a service to validate who can see whose avails..
    # for now one can only see themselves
# these will be tagged as PODO for permissions todo
